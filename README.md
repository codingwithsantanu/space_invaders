# Space Invaders
This is a very fun and engaging game development project that uses *vanilla JavaScript* and *HTML5 canvas* to create games.

## Introduction
Hey there! I'm a student and coding hobbyist from India. I love making games and applications that I can run on both my computer and play on my mobile.

This project is built using vanilla js and HTML5 canvas which not only allows us to learn and understand what's happening on a lower level but also is scalable to a large extent.

Here we have used proper sprites and appropriate sfx to make the game even more engaging.

Different types of enemies behave differently and use a proper state management system using inheritance and polymorphism. I hope you will enjoy it.

## Inspiration
This project is originally a part of a YouTube tutorial presented by [@FranksLaboratory](https://codepen.io/franksLaboratory). You can view his video from this [link](https://youtu.be/6qcw5gJrLTE?si=i8f-2tz-1jMp1gav).

> **NOTE**: I don't want to copy the work of someone else and put on my name in it. Instead, this project was made for learning by the original creator and is also used for learning.
